# Workbench Scripts

This directory is reserved for persistent operational scripts (audits, inspections, maintenance) that are **versioned** and **explicitly executed** via the wrapper.

- Place scripts in `workbench/scripts/`.
- Use the wrapper CLI command `exec <script_path>` to run them (see `impl-docs/06_tooling_protocol.md`).
